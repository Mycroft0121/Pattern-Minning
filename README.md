# Pattern-Minning
Given market based Transaction, all frequent transactions and associations are generated.

The purpose of the project is to write a program to generate all association rules whose support is greater than a user-supplied minimum support and whose confidence is greater than a user supplied minimum confidence. To achieve this recursive database projection based algorithm was used. Performance of algorithm was analysed in different scenarios i.e there were 3 different ways in which items from frequent itemlist were prcoessed and run-time of algorithm was observed. The report contains detailed analysis of algorithm and observations.
